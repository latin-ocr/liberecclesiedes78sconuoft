xvi PREFACE.

An exemption of the latter king furnishes a very early occurrence of
the exclusive privileges of Boroughs in Scotland.²

A grant of a marc of siluer, from Harold of the Orkneys? is the first
notice of the connexion which Scone had with the northern parts of
Scotland. The next is a sort of privilege or pass granted by King Alex-
ander ΙΙ., for a ship of the abbot‚ evidently on a northern adventure,
and addressed to the king's officers of Moray and CaithneSS.³ In 1332,
we find the Convent proprietors of the Church of Kildonane and the
lands of Borubol, apparently in Sutherland.⁴

Incidental notices occur of the great inundation which destroyed the
city of Perth‚ and nearly proved fatal to the royal family in 1210 ;⁶ and
the local antiquary will find evidence of the town of Dunkeld being
first gmnted to the Bishop by Alexander 11.⁶

A curious notice concerning the nativi or serfs,⁷ which might other-
wise be unintelligible, receives illustration from several entries in the
Register of Dunfermlyn, where the convent scribe has been* careful to
translate the vernacular tems-⁸

It would appear from a grant of Malcolm 1V.⁹ that the Earldom of
Gowry was then of the king’s proper inheritance. ΤΙιθ family of
Ruthven which for a short time enjoyed it after the dissolution of reli-

gious houses, proves its early pedigree mainly from this chartulary.¹⁰
