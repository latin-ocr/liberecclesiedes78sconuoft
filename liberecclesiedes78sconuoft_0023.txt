ΤΗΕ MONASTERY oF SOONE, a foundation of unknown antiquity‚ of the
Culdees or followers of St. Columba, deriving their institutions from
Iona, was re-formed by King Alexander Ι., who established in it a colony
of canons regular of the order of St. Augustino, whom he brought from
the church of St. Oswald at Nastlay near Pontefract in 'Yorkshire
The Church, previously dedicated to the Trinity, was placed under
the patronage of the Virgin, St. Michael, St. John, St. Lawrence,
and St. Augustine. The era of the new constitution was the year
1114 or 1115. At first the Superiors of Scone, as' well as of the mother
house of St. Oswald‚ appear to have been Priors, though the new foun-
dation was, from the beginning, declared independent of the English

house.

The first Prior of Scone was Robert, who was made Bishop of St.
Andrews in 1124«.l Ἰ
’ Nicolas was the next Prior, who died in 114o.2

Dionysius succeeded in 1140. He is found as a witness, in a charter
of David Ι., along with John, Bishop of Glasgow.³
