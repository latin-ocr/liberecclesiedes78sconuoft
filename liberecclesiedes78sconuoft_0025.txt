< Probably the next 'abbot was Robert, who held the office soon after
1244, and resigned it in 1270.ι

Nicholas succeeded to Robert. He was abbot in -the end of Sep-
tember 1272.2 Ηο was elected to the see of Caithness in 12733 but
returned from Rome, unconfirmed, in 1275.3

The next whom we find as abbot is Thomas, who was probably elected v

He did ho-
mage to Edward at Perth 011 1110 24111 ’,11117 1291, and again in 1296.

Ηο was abbot of 800110 when the monastery was destroyed b'y the
English army, on the 17th of August 1298,4 after the battle of Fal-
kirk. He assisted at the coronation of Robert Bruce, at Scone, on the
27111 March 1306. In September 1306, he was made prisoner by the
English army, and sent, along with the Bishops of St. Andrews >and

upon the promotion of Nicholas to the see of Caithness.

Glasgow, to England, and confined-in fetters.⁶ After these eventS, we
are not surprised to find Edward applying to the Pope, to sanction the
translation of the Abbey of Scone, from its position in the midst of a

perverse people.⁶

³ Fordun.-'1n the remarkable document which
records the delivery to Balliol of the national

muniments of Scotland, after the decision which
awarded him the kingdom in 1292, 15 mentioned a
letter of H. Abbot of 800110, obliging himself to
brew good, stent, and clear beer, (bonam, sortem,
et olarwm cervisiam) for the king and his court
as often as they should come to Scone. If the
initia! letter of this Abbot's name is correctly
given in that record, the preceding list must be
defective. No clue is afforded to the period of his
singular undertaking.
