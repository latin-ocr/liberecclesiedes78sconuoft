x PREFACE.

Thomas was the next prior of Seoue3 who died in 1154.¹ He is styled
Sootus by Fordun3 which gives rise to a conjecture, that all the preceding
priors were of the original English colony.

He was succeeded by Isaac; who died in 1162?

Robert, formerly canon of J edburgh, and prior of Restennot, suc-
· ceeded, and obtained for himself the rank of an abbot‚³ under King
Malcolm IV„ who, at the same time, confirmed all privileges and pos-
sessione of the Abbey and Church of Scone, which he recognised as the
chief seat of government.⁴ ’ Robert, the first abbot, died in 1186.

He was succeeded by Robert‚ formerly the prior; who, in 1198, re-
signed his abbacy.⁵

Reinbald succeeded, who was a withess to the foundation charter of
Inchaffray in 1200, and toa charter of Dunean, Earl of Fife, by which
he granted the church of Kilconcath to the nuns of North Berwick.⁶
He was abbot, subsequent to the promotion of William Malvoisin to
the see of St. Andrews in 1202]

William seems to have ,been the next abbot. He held the office in
1211 and1213,⁸ and continued abbot in 1225}

Philip was abbot of Scone on the 6th of the Ides of June 1231,¹⁰
in 12373Ι and 1242.ss
