PREFAOE. xvii

Their later history compriseS‚ in two generations of Earls, more romanoe
and mystery than have fallen to the lot of any other name in the
Scotch peerage. On the forfeiture of John Earl of Gowry, David first
Viscount of Stormont obtained a grant of the Abbacy of Scone.

The old Chartulary of Scone is a small thin folio written on parch-
ment, consisting of 32 leaves, and containing transcripts of 83 different
deeds. It is defective in several place8‚ and the sheets which remain
have not been properly bound. This chartulary does not contain the
foundation charter of the Abbey by Alexander Ι. The earliest deed is
a bull of Pope Alexander II. in 1164; and with the exception of the
four deeds which occur at the end of the volume, the latest are the
charters by Robert I., which are dated in the aoth year of his reign,
or 1326. From that circumstance, and from the character of the
writing, we may pronounce it to have been written not later than the
year 1350. This volume formed part of Sir J ames Balfour’s collection,
and was purchased in 1698, along with his other MSS„ by the Faculty
of Advocates, in whose library it now is.

The other and more recent chartulary is a larger folio on parch-
ment, bound in blue morocco. It consists. of 76 leaves, and at the
end of the volume there are about 50 leaves which have been left
blank. As the 76th leaf terminates in the middle of a deed, and the
three or four succeeding leaves are ruled‚ so as to mark that there had
originally been an intention of proceeding farther, it may be pre.
sumed that the scribe was interrupted before his task was completed.
This chartulary contains 148 deeds, many of which are not contained
