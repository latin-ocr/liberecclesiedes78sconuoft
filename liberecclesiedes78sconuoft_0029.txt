half fabulous story of the Moot Hill, j0ined to the real evidence of the
existence of the fatal chair of coronation.

At Scone was crowned Alexander ΙΙ., and here, at the coronation of
his son, the last of that noble dynasty, while the Prince was yet seated
on the inaugural throne, bearing his crown and seeptre, and the nobles
of the land at his feet, stood forth an aged Highlander, dressed after his
country guise, and in his native speech, with bended knee, addressed
the new crowned monarch, and hailed him as Alexander, MacAlexander‚
MacWilliam, MacHenry‚ MaeDavid, MacMalcolm, tracing his lineage
up to Fergus, the first king of the Scots in Britain.¹

Here, in 1292, the unhappy Balliol assumed the crown.

And here, in 1306, Robert Bruce, a fugitive and excommunicated,
without means or friends in Scotland, raising his arm against the might
of Edward and of England, was crowned King of Scots?

So far as this Register ooncems the endowment and constitution of
the Abbey, its possessions and privileges, the tenure of its property, and
the transactions with its neighbours‚ by which these documents become
the foundation of the territorial history of a wide district, it seems unne-
cessary here to make either selection or comment. Every document, and
the facts recorded in it, will be interesting to the student of the local
antiquities of Gowry, and the lower divisions of Perth and Angus. A
few points of historical or more general interest may be briefly noticed.

The grant by Alex. 1.³ confirmed by Malcolm IV.⁴ of an exclusive juris-

diction, and a court, with trial by duel and ordeal, is unusually minute.
