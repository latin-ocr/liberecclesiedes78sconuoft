xx PREFACE.

tion in a country gentleman of the reign of Robert Bruce, has furnished
u's with a small treasure of the earliest written Scotch that has been
preserved in its original shape. ’ ”

The' seal of the Abbey, which facesthe title-page, is taken from a
recent impression of a stamp which must have been of consider-
able antiquity. The seal represents the eniblems of the Trinity within
the mystical vesica pzkciS, surrounded by the symbols of the four evan-
geliste, and below, ‘ the figure of St. Michael· and the dragon. The
counter·seal seems to represent the ceremony of coronation of the
Scotch monarch, who is much in the dress and habiliments seen in the
great seal of Robert I. Below, are the royal ame, between the 'pales of
Ruthven and the chevrons of the Earldom of Stratherne.

Of the buildings of the Monastery and ancient Palace of Scone, pro-
bably ve'ry little survived the storm of the Reformation. The house used
by the successive commendators was almost entirely removed to make
way for the present ‘ Palace' of the Earl of Mansfield. A rough, but
evidently faithful view of that building, as it stood in 1775, is given on
the opposite page, from the original plate‚ for the use of which the
Clubs are indebted to the liberality of Mr. D. Laing. It is the work
of Archibald Rutherfurd, who is believed to have been a drawing-
master in Edinburgh, and to have died in 1779.
